This code gives you the ability to store your images in the recogt_Rcs File under your name, and then use
those images to train the program to recognize each person when he faces the camera. 

You will need to install opencv-python library as well as, opencv-contrib in order to compile the code.

Please make sure to store your images using the faceGrabber.py first then training the program with
the second file which is faceTrainer.py. 

When you compile the faceGrabber.py file, you will be tasked to input a name. Please insert your name,
or the name of the person that the camera is going to take pictures of.

While compiling the faceTrainer file, you will be given two choices before the training part starts. You
are free to chose between LBPH algorithm, or Eigen algorithm in order to do the face detection.

Enjoy !!
